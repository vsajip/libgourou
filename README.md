Introduction
------------

libgourou is a free implementation of Adobe's ADEPT protocol used to add DRM on ePub/PDF files. It overcomes the lack of Adobe support for Linux platforms.


Architecture
------------

Like RMSDK, libgourou has a client/server scheme. All platform specific functions (crypto, network...) have to be implemented in a client class (that derives from DRMProcessorClient) while server implements ADEPT protocol.
A reference implementation using cURL, OpenSSL and libzip is provided (in _utils_ directory).

Main functions to use from gourou::DRMProcessor are:

  * Get an ePub from an ACSM file : _fulfill()_ and _download()_
  * Create a new device : _createDRMProcessor()_
  * Register a new device : _signIn()_ and _activateDevice()_
  * Remove DRM : _removeDRM()_
  * Return loaned book : _returnLoan()_

You can import configuration from (at least):

  * Kobo device    : .adept/device.xml, .adept/devicesalt  and .adept/activation.xml
  * Bookeen device : .adobe-digital-editions/device.xml, root/devkey.bin and .adobe-digital-editions/activation.xml
  
Or create a new one. Be careful: there is a limited number of devices that can be created by one account.

ePub are encrypted using a shared key: one account / multiple devices, so you can create and register a device into your computer and read downloaded (and encrypted) ePub file with your eReader configured using the same AdobeID account.

For those who want to remove DRM without adept_remove, you can export your private key and import it within [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) an its DeDRM plugin.


Dependencies
------------

For libgourou:

_externals_ :

  * libpugixml

_internals_:

  * uPDFParser

For utils:

  * libcurl
  * OpenSSL
  * libzip
  * libpugixml


Internal libraries are automatically fetched and statically compiled during the first run.
When you update libgourou's repository, **don't forget to update internal libraries** with:

    make update_lib


Compilation
-----------

Use _make_ command

    make [CROSS=XXX] [DEBUG=(0*|1)] [STATIC_UTILS=(0*|1)] [BUILD_UTILS=(0|1*)] [BUILD_STATIC=(0*|1)] [BUILD_SHARED=(0|1*)] [all*|clean|ultraclean|build_utils|install|uninstall]

CROSS can define a cross compiler prefix (ie arm-linux-gnueabihf-)

DEBUG can be set to compile in DEBUG mode

BUILD_UTILS to build utils or not

STATIC_UTILS to build utils with static library (libgourou.a) instead of default dynamic one (libgourou.so)

BUILD_STATIC build libgourou.a if 1, nothing if 0, can be combined with BUILD_SHARED

BUILD_SHARED build libgourou.so if 1, nothing if 0, can be combined with BUILD_STATIC

other variables are DESTDIR and PREFIX to handle destination install directory

* Default value


Utils
-----

First, add libgourou.so to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD

You can optionaly specify your .adept directory

    export ADEPT_DIR=/home/XXX

Then, use utils as following:

You can import configuration from your eReader or create a new one with _utils/adept\_activate_:

    ./utils/adept_activate -u <AdobeID USERNAME>

Then a _/home/<user>/.config/adept_ directory is created with all configuration file

To download an ePub/PDF:

    ./utils/acsmdownloader <ACSM_FILE>

To export your private key (for DeDRM software):

    ./utils/acsmdownloader --export-private-key [-o adobekey_1.der]

To remove ADEPT DRM:

    ./utils/adept_remove <encryptedFile>

To list loaned books:

    ./utils/adept_loan_mgt [-l]

To return a loaned book:

    ./utils/adept_loan_mgt -r <id>


You can get utils full options description with -h or --help switch
